## Projects:

<strong>1) GoalScheduler 📔</strong>

<div>
<a href="https://github.com/CcConStanTine/GoalScheduler">GoalScheduler - Repository</a>
</div></br>

Web REST application, the main purpose of this application is to mirror a real-life goal planner with some fancy features which computers are able to do. 
Actual functionalities in a shortcut:
- register, login (security is working properly - there is no chance of calling other user's resources)
- creating, modifying or deleting long-term/year/month/week/day plans
- creating summaries of year/month/week/day

Future functionalities I plan to add:
- creating a repeatable day plans, which when we log in, will be filled in the current day automatically
- creating a set of achivements based on application functionalities (like logging for 10 days in a row, fullfilling 100 day plans etc.)
The whole application concept was mine, but currently there is a Front-End Developer which is creating the front side of this application, so there is possiblity it will be deployed soon. 
- creating a funciontality of assigning the plans which are lower in hierachy (DayPlan<WeekPlan<...<LongTermPlan), to the higher in hierarchy plans to create a connection between them, for purpose of monitoring the progress of achieving the complicated plans which consist of the smaller ones

<strong>2) TrainingCenter 🏋️</strong>

<div>
<a href="https://github.com/CodeEnthusiasts/TrainingCenter">TrainingCenter - Repository</a>

Web REST app that allows to create own personal training diary.
Application is still being developed. 


I learned and I am still learning a lot about:
- working in a group of developers, 
- organization in a group projects, 
- contributing in group projects.
